# COVID-19 Data Exploration

Overview: This project explores various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic using SQL queries to analyze data on vaccinations, deaths, and infection rates across different countries and continents. Key techniques applied include data transformation, aggregation, and trend analysis.

**Key Skills & Concepts:**

* Joins: Combined data from multiple tables to examine vaccination and death trends.
* Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Utilized to streamline complex queries and improve readability.
* Temporary Tables: Implemented to store intermediate results for in-depth analysis of vaccination percentages.
* Window Functions: Used for rolling calculations and comparing daily vaccination rates.
* Aggregate Functions: Applied to summarize global COVID-19 data, such as infection rates and death percentages.
* Views: Created for easier data visualization and future reference.
* Data Conversion: Ensured accurate calculations by converting data types as needed.

**Key Insights:**

* Determined death rates as a percentage of total cases.
* Analyzed the percentage of populations infected and vaccinated by country.
* Calculated daily vaccination changes and identified countries with the highest infection and death rates.
* Tools: SQL (Joins, CTEs, Temp Tables, Window Functions, Aggregate Functions), Views, Data Types Conversion
